	<div>What Are CSS Variables? </div>

</div>CSS variables, or custom properties, are like named values you set up in your CSS code to be reused wherever you
need.
They allow you to set a value once, like a color or font size, and then use it in multiple places. This can be really
helpful for keeping styles consistent and easy to update.</div>


<h2>Think of it like this:</h2>

<div>1. In JavaScript, you might write: let mainColor = "#3498db"; to store a color.</div>
<div>2. In CSS, you can do something similar with a CSS variable: --main-color: #3498db;</div>

<div>Once you set up a CSS variable, you can refer to it throughout your CSS file using var(--main-color). This makes
	your
	CSS much easier to manage and change.</div>


<h2><strong>How CSS Variables Work</strong></h2>
<div>Define the variable (give it a name and a value).</div>
<div>Use the variable (refer to it by name wherever you need it).</div>

<h2>In this example:</h2>

<div>--main-color is a CSS variable that holds the color #3498db.
	<br />
	--text-size is a CSS variable that holds the font size 16px.
