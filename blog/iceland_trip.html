	<h1>My trip to Iceland </h1>
	<p>It was a cold and rainy day in Iceland. I was walking down the street when I saw a beautiful waterfall. I took a
		picture of it and posted it on Instagram. It got a lot of likes and comments. I felt like a real influencer. I also
		saw the Northern Lights, which was amazing. I can't wait to go back to Iceland and explore more of the country.</p>
